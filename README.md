# Tutorial: Creating a Chunked Dataset of arXiv Papers for a Vector Database

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a chunked dataset of arXiv papers, which can later be used for a vector database. We will cover the following steps:

1. **Downloading the metadata dataset from Kaggle**
2. **Processing and chunking the dataset**
3. **Setting up and leveraging the dataset for a vector database**

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to transform arXiv papers into a format suitable for a vector database.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `json`, `os`, `datetime`, `requests`, `PyPDF2`, `pandas`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install requests PyPDF2 pandas
```

## Step 1: Download the Metadata Dataset from Kaggle

First, you need to download the arXiv metadata dataset from Kaggle. You can use the Kaggle API or a direct download link.

### Using `curl` to Download the Dataset

To download the dataset using `curl`, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
curl -L -o arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv
```

## Step 2: Extract Relevant Metadata

We will process the metadata to extract the IDs of papers updated after a certain date.

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Define the date cutoff
date_cutoff = datetime.strptime("2024-06-01", "%Y-%m-%d")

# Path to the JSON metadata file
metadata_path = "arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json"

# Extract relevant metadata
paper_ids = []
with open(metadata_path, encoding="utf8") as f:
    for entry in f:
        data = json.loads(entry)
        update_date = datetime.strptime(data.get("update_date", ""), "%Y-%m-%d")
        if update_date >= date_cutoff:
            paper_ids.append(data.get("id", ""))
```

## Step 3: Download PDFs of the Papers

Next, we will download the PDFs of the selected papers.

```python
import os
import requests

# Construct the list of PDF URLs
base_url = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/"
pdf_urls = [f"{base_url}{paper_id}.pdf" for paper_id in paper_ids]

# Ensure the directory to save downloaded PDFs exists
download_directory = "./downloaded_pdfs/"
os.makedirs(download_directory, exist_ok=True)

# Function to download a single PDF
def download_pdf(url, directory):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        filename = os.path.join(directory, url.split('/')[-1])
        with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(response.content)
        print(f"Downloaded {filename}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to download {url}")

# Download all PDFs
for pdf_url in pdf_urls:
    download_pdf(pdf_url, download_directory)

print("Download complete.")
```

## Step 4: Convert PDFs to Text

We will convert the downloaded PDFs to text files for easier processing.

```python
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

# Define the directory containing the downloaded PDFs
pdf_directory = "./downloaded_pdfs/"

# Define the directory to save the TXT files
txt_directory = "./converted_txt/"
os.makedirs(txt_directory, exist_ok=True)

# Function to convert a single PDF to TXT
def convert_pdf_to_txt(pdf_path, txt_path):
    try:
        with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as pdffileobj:
            pdfreader = PdfReader(pdffileobj)
            text = ""
            for page in pdfreader.pages:
                text += page.extract_text()
            
            with open(txt_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as txtfile:
                txtfile.write(text)
            
            print(f"Converted {pdf_path} to {txt_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to convert {pdf_path}: {e}")

# Iterate over all PDFs in the directory and convert them to TXT
for pdf_filename in os.listdir(pdf_directory):
    if pdf_filename.endswith('.pdf'):
        pdf_path = os.path.join(pdf_directory, pdf_filename)
        txt_filename = os.path.splitext(pdf_filename)[0] + '.txt'
        txt_path = os.path.join(txt_directory, txt_filename)
        convert_pdf_to_txt(pdf_path, txt_path)
```

## Step 5: Chunk Text and Add Metadata
Understanding the Concept
Chunking is the process of breaking down a large text into smaller, manageable pieces or chunks. This is especially useful for large documents like research papers, where processing the entire text as a single unit can be inefficient and overwhelming. By breaking the text into smaller chunks, we can more easily analyze, process, and store the data.

Additionally, metadata refers to data that provides information about other data. For example, metadata for a research paper might include the paper's title, authors, abstract, and publication date. When we chunk the text of a paper, we want to retain this metadata so that each chunk of text can be linked back to the original paper and its details.

By chunking the text and adding metadata, we can prepare the data for various applications, such as building a vector database where each chunk of text, along with its associated metadata, can be indexed and searched efficiently.
We will chunk the text files into smaller parts and add metadata for each chunk.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Path to the JSON metadata file
metadata_path = "arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json"

# Extract metadata and store in a dictionary
metadata_dict = {}
with open(metadata_path, encoding="utf8") as f:
    for entry in f:
        data = json.loads(entry)
        paper_id = data.get("id", "")
        metadata_dict[paper_id] = data

# Function to chunk text
def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=1000):
    return [text[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size)]

# Define the directory containing the TXT files
txt_directory = "./converted_txt/"

# Store the chunks and their metadata
chunks_data = []

for txt_filename in os.listdir(txt_directory):
    if txt_filename.endswith('.txt'):
        paper_id = os.path.splitext(txt_filename)[0]
        txt_path = os.path.join(txt_directory, txt_filename)
        
        # Read the TXT file contents
        with open(txt_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as txtfile:
            text = txtfile.read()
        
        # Chunk the text
        chunks = chunk_text(text)
        
        # Get the metadata for this paper
        if paper_id in metadata_dict:
            metadata = metadata_dict[paper_id]
        else:
            print(f"Metadata not found for paper ID: {paper_id}")
            continue
        
        # Store each chunk with its metadata
        for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
            chunk_id = f"{paper_id}_{i}"
            chunk_data = {
                "chunk_id": chunk_id,
                "chunk": chunk,
            }
            # Add metadata fields to chunk_data
            chunk_data.update(metadata)
            chunks_data.append(chunk_data)

# Convert the data to a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(chunks_data)

# Define the path to the output CSV file
csv_output_path = "chunks_metadata.csv"

# Save the DataFrame to a CSV file
df.to_csv(csv_output_path, index=False)

print("CSV file created successfully.")
```
